<pre>ZKG Counter Upload v3 (Drive save)
-----------------------------------
What it does:
- Upload screenshots, OCR values (TCP Team N, TCP Counter O, Punchup/Down M, TCP Diff P, Victory Points Q)
- Appends a row to the sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mq88NZUs6rIsbQFGmR_4koqxZofYeFS063-S81GtShk/edit  (tab: Counters)
- Saves each image to Drive folder ID: 1hQ8Egts2ypNSLbpSW6m_JxENq5l6shnw and writes the file URL into column S

Setup:
1) Open Apps Script attached to your sheet, paste Code.gs, Deploy as Web app:
   - Execute as: Me
   - Who has access: Anyone
2) Copy the /exec URL and confirm script.js CONFIG.backendUrl matches:
   https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbxpfCHGLVfinE17iFvgxhZsIi2Ld5-jVMXYY068GiP2Vv93P-wXN6HXOOMu7lO5HRgk/exec
3) Push these files to GitHub Pages.

Notes:
- Frontend sends JSON with Content-Type: text/plain to avoid CORS preflight.
- Images are processed client-side and also Base64-uploaded to Apps Script for Drive save.
